Let's continue our journey of teaching programming. In the previous post we talked about preparation and what we can do before starting the actual course. In this post we'll get into some ideas and practices we can use during the lessons.

This is the second part of series focused on teaching programming. You can read the first part [here](https://ugurtekbas.com/lessons-ive-learned-by-teaching-programming/){:target="_blank"}.

## Show Time
How you deliver knowledge is as important as the knowledge itself. You can use some technics and methodologies which will clear most of the question marks for students. Some of the methods below
that I planned prior the lessons and some of them I came up after. As long as it works
for the students, it's totally fine to change, add or discover different ways during the whole course.

Now you're prepared and here you are, stage is yours!

### Keep It Simple
Like in one of the most underrated [software principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle){:target="_blank"}, keep it very simple when you’re explaining new concepts or languages. Associate the concept with something concrete from real life. This will make the subject less scary and easier to understand for students.

You can also apply explaining-to-5-year-old rule, don’t worry people won’t	mind, they just want to understand things.

Another advise would be: don’t give examples right away. Make them understand it first then do a general example which covers the topic. This way you also avoid squeezing the topic only in one example which might limit their way of looking at it.

### Practice makes it perfect, practice makes it amazing
It’s very important to make students practice right on the spot. They learn way more than any other kind of method. Power of practicing within the lessons is underrated…or I just didn’t know about it.

It might feel weird to give students few 15 minutes at a limited lesson but it would worth it. First keep the practice simple, let them try to figure out, watch how they approach the problem, you can literally sneak up to their monitor and talk about their approach. After 10-15 minutes, code the practice yourself live, where they can easily follow. If there are multiple solution to the problem, you can show few different approaches. As a last step, show them a real life example about the exact practice. It could be adding a nice footer to your website or using random function in JavaScript.

On their way to practice [10000 hours rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)){:target="_blank"} students need to practice outside of the course too, it’s called "Homework". Coming up with good homework is really hard (shout out to all my former teachers out there who came up with creative homework when I was studying). I consider three things while preparing a homework;

- Including the subjects we learned at the last lesson
- Making it useful so that they can easily imagine different implementation of what they’re doing for their different ideas
- Making it challenging

During my first course, I noticed it’s good to have continuous homework rather than creating a new one every time. I call it lego-style-homework (I literally made it up the naming). What you do is giving small pieces of homework, which fulfill 3 items above, after first lesson and in every lesson after that you add new parts to previous homework. At the end of the course, students will have a useful product which is absolutely built by them.

When I was teaching web development, I asked students to come up with a website idea, create their first html file, give it a title and put a headline in the middle of the page. After learning about different tags (like link, image etc.) I asked them to create a top menu bar and navigate to different pages. Following that, I asked them to create footer, put images in the centre of their page, create columns, write long paragraphs, when they learn how to use Bootstrap I asked them to replace columns by using grids, create a design for their site using CSS, add a form to their contact page etc.

I also ask them to do research on specific topics, just to get the basic ideas and to understand that this is also part of programming, a huge part of it. I believe power of homework, it effects the learning process significantly, especially for practice heavy fields, such as coding.

## Question or to be questioned
They will want to ask anything and everything which is absolutely fine. Your job is to make them fell totally relax about asking questions. Show them they can stop you and ask questions any time, no matter how silly or simple they are.

</figure>

You can do this by repeating the sentence “Do you have any questions?” every time after explaining something or asking them questions during lessons to see if they are clear of any confusion. You can also show them how to get answers theirselves which is simple googling. Demonstrate how to search for usage of an attribute or documentation by just googling in front of their eyes, guide them to the wonderland of StackOverflow.

## Give them a break
Not joking :) Small breaks are part of the lesson, it helps to refresh and take a deep breath before solving that annoying bug. At my first lesson, I was so focused I forgot to give a break. That was the first thing we discussed at the end of the day, at our daily retro.

## Have fun
It’s essential! Try to make it fun for anyone who attends the lessons. It’s already hard enough to learn new things so make sure it’s fun. Create a comfy, easy environment and a soft language to follow effortlessly.

There are programming related games where you can have fun while testing your coding skills. You can play them all together or give as a homework.

These are the main practices I've followed for my course. I've received good feedback during and after the lessons as we discussed more about our approaches end of every day.
